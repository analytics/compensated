Analytics was started by [Edward Kmett](https://github.com/ekmett) in response to a question by [Alec Heller](https://github.com/deviant-logic) about if he should use `bound` to implement datalog. It has since somewhat expanded in scope.

`compensated` was split out of the `analytics` repository.

Improvements to the multiplication algorithm used in this package and many small tweaks like the ability to iterate the `Compensated` construction were made after prolonged discussions on the topic with Dan Doel. Any errors in the algorithm are my fault, however.

You can watch contributors carry on the quest for bragging rights in the [contributors graph](https://github.com/analytics/compensated/graphs/contributors).

Omission from this list is by no means an attempt to discount your contribution.

Thank you for all of your help!
